# CIPHERVAULT — README

A single-file, client-side password manager. Everything runs in your browser; there's no server, no account, and no API keys involved. This doc covers how to use it safely and what to avoid.

> ⚠ **Experimental / testing build.** Not audited. Don't make this your only copy of any password — keep the encrypted backup (see below) somewhere else too.

---

## Quick Start

1. Open `cipher_vault.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).
2. First time: choose a master password (8+ characters). This password is **never stored anywhere** — if you forget it, your data cannot be recovered by anyone, including you.
3. That's it — you're in the vault.

**To use it again later**, just reopen the same file in the same browser on the same device. Your data persists automatically between sessions.

---

## What It Stores

- **Logins** — username, password, URL, notes
- **Cards** — number, expiry, CVV, cardholder
- **Secure notes** — free text
- **Recovery codes** — one service, many one-time codes
- **2FA / TOTP** — generates live 6-digit codes from a secret you paste in
- **Passkey log** — a *reference record* only (site + account), not the actual passkey. Real passkeys live in your browser/OS/security key and can't be exported by any tool, including this one — that's by design, not a limitation of this app specifically.

Every item can also have a **folder** (one) and **tags** (many) for organizing.

---

## Security Model (what's actually protecting your data)

- **Key derivation:** Argon2id (memory-hard, OWASP baseline params) for new vaults, with an automatic silent upgrade path for older vaults. If Argon2id can't load (no internet on first use), it falls back to PBKDF2 at 600,000 rounds — still strong, just not the newer algorithm.
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for the vault contents.
- **Where it's stored:** the encrypted blob lives in `localStorage`, scoped to this file in your browser. It is not readable without your master password — the app itself never has a "backdoor" into it.
- **Auto-lock:** clears the decryption key from memory after inactivity (configurable), and optionally on tab-switch/window-blur too.
- **Clipboard:** copied passwords auto-clear after a configurable delay.

### Honest limitations
- This is a hobby project, not a professionally audited security product.
- Argon2id and the strength meter (zxcvbn) load from a CDN. If you're fully offline the first time you use a feature, it falls back gracefully rather than breaking — but it does mean a working connection is needed at least once.
- Biometric unlock relies on your browser/authenticator supporting the WebAuthn `prf` extension. Not all browsers do yet (Safari doesn't as of writing). If it's not supported, you'll just see no biometric option — nothing breaks, password unlock always works.
- "Memory zeroization" is best-effort. JavaScript can't guarantee true memory erasure (garbage collection can leave copies) — this hardens what it can, but isn't a cryptographic guarantee.
- **`localStorage` is tied to exactly how you open the file.** If your browser treats `file:///path/to/cipher_vault.html` as its own storage origin (most do), then moving, renaming, or opening a different copy of the file can look like a "different" vault to the browser, even though the file content is identical. If your data ever seems to vanish, check that you're opening the exact same file path as before, in the exact same browser, before assuming something's wrong.

---

## ⚠ Things That Will Actually Break Things

- **Don't move or rename the file after you've started using it**, for the reason above — your browser may treat that as an entirely different vault location.
- **Don't open the same vault in two tabs/windows and edit in both.** Storage writes don't merge — the last save wins, and the other tab's changes can be silently lost. Use one tab at a time.
- **Don't clear your browser's site data / "cookies and other site data"** for this page unless you've exported a backup first — that's how the vault is stored, and clearing it deletes the vault.
- **Private/incognito windows may not persist data at all** — some browsers isolate or block storage there. If you see a yellow banner at the top saying storage isn't available, switch to a normal window before entering anything you care about.
- **Don't lose your master password.** There is no reset, no recovery email, no "forgot password" — that's the whole point of it being real encryption. This is exactly what the **Emergency Kit** (Settings → Emergency Kit) is for: print it, hand-write your password on the paper copy, and store that somewhere physically secure.
- **If you switch browsers or devices, your vault doesn't come with you automatically.** Export an encrypted backup (Settings → Backup) and import it on the new device/browser.

---

## Backups (do this regularly)

Two different export options exist — use the right one:

| | Encrypted Backup | CSV Export |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** | Settings → Backup | Settings → Transfer Passwords (CSV) |
| **Format** | Still encrypted — useless without your master password | Plaintext — anyone who opens the file can read every password |
| **Use for** | Personal backups, moving to a new device | Moving logins into a *different* password manager |
| **What's included** | Everything (logins, cards, notes, recovery codes, 2FA) | Logins only |

**After a CSV import/export, delete the CSV file from your downloads folder.** The app reminds you of this after every CSV import for the same reason.

---

## Settings Reference

- **Auto-lock** — how long the vault stays unlocked with no activity
- **Lock on focus loss** — locks immediately when you switch tabs/windows, not just after the timer
- **Clipboard auto-clear** — how long a copied password stays on the clipboard
- **Biometric unlock** — enable/disable fingerprint/face/security-key unlock (if your browser supports it)
- **Master password** — change it any time; re-encrypts everything under the new password
- **Trash** — deleted items sit here 30 days before permanent removal; restore anything deleted by mistake here

---

## Security Audit Tab

Run from the sidebar. Checks for:
- **Reused passwords** — fully local, no network call
- **Weak passwords** — via zxcvbn (or a local heuristic if that hasn't loaded)
- **Breached passwords** — opt-in button, calls the free HIBP API (`api.pwnedpasswords.com`). Only the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 hash are sent — your actual password never leaves the browser — but it does require internet and is a third-party request, so it's manual, not automatic.

---

## No API Keys, No Accounts

Nothing in this app requires signup, an API key, or a paid service. Every external call is either to a free/keyless public endpoint (HIBP) or a public CDN script (Argon2id, zxcvbn), and both degrade gracefully if unreachable.

---

## Anti-Tampering / Anti-Brute-Force Protections

Added specifically against two threat scenarios: someone (or some script) repeatedly guessing your master password, and something trying to inject malicious code into the page.

- **Escalating lockout on failed unlock attempts** — after 3 wrong passwords, each further attempt triggers a growing delay (10s → 20s → 40s → up to 5 min). This is tracked in storage, not just in memory, so reloading the page doesn't reset it — a script hammering the unlock function programmatically gets slowed down, not just a human retyping.
- **Masked-by-default sensitive fields** — passwords, card numbers, and CVVs are hidden by default while editing (👁 to reveal), not shown in plaintext automatically. Reduces exposure to shoulder-surfing and screen-capture malware.
- **`autocomplete="off"`/`"new-password"` on master password and card fields** — reduces the chance of a browser extension or malicious autofill tool harvesting them.
- **Graceful storage fallback** — if `localStorage` isn't available at all (e.g. certain private-browsing configurations), the app shows a visible warning banner and keeps working for the session instead of silently losing your data — you just won't have anything saved once you close the tab.

### What's deliberately *not* included, and why
- **Content-Security-Policy** — tried this, and it broke vault creation: it turned out to be blocking storage entirely (see below). Removed it rather than guess at the right exception to carve out — I can't verify CSP behavior against this app's storage from where I build it.
- **CDN file hash pinning (Subresource Integrity)** — would be the strongest protection against a compromised CDN, but I couldn't verify the exact byte hash of the hosted files from my end. A wrong hash would silently and permanently block Argon2id/zxcvbn from loading with no clear explanation, which is worse than the current graceful fallback. If you want this, generate the `integrity="sha384-..."` values yourself (e.g. via `curl <url> | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`) and add them to the two `<script>` tags in the `<head>`.
- **Anti-devtools / anti-inspection tricks** — things like disabling right-click or detecting an open console. These are widely considered security theater: they're trivially bypassed and mostly just annoy legitimate users. Skipped on purpose.

### Version history worth knowing about
Three bugs were introduced and fixed during hardening, in case you're on an older copy of this file:
1. An added Content-Security-Policy blocked the storage mechanism entirely, freezing the "Deriving key…" button forever with no error. Fixed by removing the CSP.
2. Persistence was originally built on `window.storage`, an API that only exists inside Claude's own in-chat preview — not in a real browser opening this file directly, which caused an immediate `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')"` error. Fixed by switching to standard `localStorage`.
3. **A real stored-XSS vulnerability**, found during a self-audit: usernames, card numbers, tags, folder names, and password-history entries were inserted into `onclick="..."` attributes using an escaper that didn't account for the surrounding double-quoted HTML attribute. A value containing a `"` character — typed manually, or delivered via a crafted CSV/backup import — could break out of the attribute and inject an arbitrary event handler that ran with full access to the decrypted vault in memory. Fixed by switching those to `data-*` attributes read via `element.dataset`, which eliminates the injection surface structurally rather than patching the escaping. If you imported any CSV files or backups from untrusted sources before this fix, it's worth reviewing those items' usernames/tags/folders for anything that looks like it contains `onmouseover=`, `onerror=`, or similar — that's a sign a prior import tried to exploit this.

If you're running a copy from before all three of these fixes, re-download the current version.

### Verifying this file hasn't been altered since I generated it
If you're worried about malware modifying the `.html` file on disk after the fact, you can check it against this checksum:

```
SHA-256: 8b64526ef2c0e9e1b19befba21d647165db90055e064d56c9a2c1bd0b2886500
```

Verify with:
- **macOS/Linux:** `shasum -a 256 cipher_vault.html`
- **Windows (PowerShell):** `Get-FileHash cipher_vault.html -Algorithm SHA256`

If the hash doesn't match, something changed the file — don't open it with a real vault password until you know why.
